      <p>Understanding that no single application can cater to the unique needs and preferences of every individual,
        I've empowered users to tailor their experience by developing their own plugins. This customization ensures that the functionality of the
        application aligns perfectly with your requirements. StreamController features enhanced plugin support, enabling developers like you to easily create plugins using Python.</p>
